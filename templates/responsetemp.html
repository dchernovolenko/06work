      Hello <b>{{usr}}</b>, my old friend<br>
      I've come to talk with you again<br>
      Because a vision softly creeping<br>
      Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
      And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
      Still remains<br>
      Within the sound of silence<br>
<br>
      In restless dreams I walked alone<br>
      Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
      'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br>
      I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
      When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
      That split the night<br>
      And touched the sound of silence<br>
<br>
      And in the naked light I saw<br>
      Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
      People talking without speaking<br>
      People hearing without listening<br>
      People writing songs that voices never share<br>
      And no one dared<br>
      Disturb the sound of silence<br>
<br>
      Fools, said I, you do not know<br>
      Silence like a cancer grows<br>
      Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
      Take my arms that I might reach you<br>
      But my words, like silent raindrops fell<br>
      And echoed in the wells of silence<br>
<br>
      And the people bowed and prayed<br>
      To the neon god they made<br>
      And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
      In the words that it was forming<br>
      And the sign said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls<br>
      And tenement halls<br>
      And whispered in the sounds of silence<br>
      <br>
